## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following modules based on my learning path:

### 1. **Basics of Python**
* Core syntax, variables, and data types.
* Conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
* Fundamental Input/Output operations and error handling.

### 2. **Date and Time**
* Mastering the `datetime` module.
* learn methods like `.now()`, `.today()`,`.strftime()`.

### 3. **Math Functions**
* Deep dive into the `math` library for mathematical constants and functions.
* learn methods like `.fabs()`, `.sqrt()`,`.pow()`.

### 4. **OOPs Concepts**
This section focuses on writing scalable and modular code using Object-Oriented Programming:
* **Classes & Objects**: Defining blueprints and creating real-world instances.
* **Inheritance**: implementing example of inheritance.
* **Encapsulation**: demonstartion of Encapsulation.
* **Polymorphism**: Implementing Method Overriding and Overloading concepts.
* **Abstraction**: demonstartion of abstarction acheive by the classes and objects.

### 5. **String Class in Python**
* Advanced string manipulation and indexing.
* Practical use of built-in methods like `.upper()`, `.split()`.
